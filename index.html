          <ul>
            <li><h4>kelsey<h4></li>
              <li><strong>How did you meet?</strong> Trolling the Internet. More specifically, OkCupid, which at least 5 other couples attending our wedding have to thank for their marriages!</li>
              <li><strong>What was the first thing you noticed about Jim on your first date?</strong> His outfit (green chinos, blue plaid shirt), which I later learned several female friends helped him pick out. Also that he was disappointingly less ginger than I had anticipated.</li>
              <li><strong>When did you know he was &quot;the one&quot;?</strong> Probably before we even met when Jim wowed me with his ability to make a concrete plan, and again at the end of our first date when we immediately made plans to go out again the next day. I was so impressed that we were basically engaged by our third date.</li>
              <li><strong>What are the three words you would use to describe Jim?</strong> Patient, Warm, Furry</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
              <li><h4>jim<h4></li>
                <li><strong>How did you meet?</strong> The internet because that&rsquo;s how all modern love stories start. We were supposed to be a 93% match according to OK cupid and she was much more attractive than me (Aunt Karen&rsquo;s two rules of dating: She must be prettier, she must be smarter) so I sent her a thoughtful bit of prose which she ignored for almost a month before accepting her destiny.</li>
                <li><strong>What was the first thing you noticed about Kelsey on your first date?</strong> She was well-dressed and had strong control of the English language. Also that she looked just like her photos online which was refreshing. Her hair is very blonde.</li>
                <li><strong>When did you know she was &quot;the one&quot;?</strong> When we had 5 dates in the first week and that wasn&rsquo;t enough time to spend together!</li>
                <li><strong>What are the three words you would use to describe Kelsey?</strong> Smart, Opinionated, Savage.</li>

                    <p class="wed-party-backstory">As with all great friendships, Marggie and Kelsey met at Anthropologie. What started as a roommateship of convenience soon turned into a deep companionship full of Taylor Swift, closet fashion shows, shower wine, and innumerable shared Uber rides. Marggie was Kelsey&rsquo;s teammate in the dating game and has welcomed Jim (and Atwood) into the Sacred Nest with unending patience and warmth. By far the worst part of this marriage is the end of the lease on Bedford Street.</p>

                    <p class="wed-party-backstory">Carly and Kelsey met on the famed 2nd floor of Alvey Hall freshman year of college and fell so in love they chose to live together for three more years. They spent the majority of their time at UMW singing Rilo Kiley songs into hairbrushes and wearing extremely cringe-worthy outfits to parties. Carly&rsquo;s work saving all of the rhinos on the planet keeps her busy on weekends, but fortunately she always finds time to share a fancy Cheesecake Factory lunch with Kelsey and keep the love alive.</p>

                    <p class="wed-party-backstory">Diana and Kelsey met in preschool and quickly bonded over American Girl dolls, which they continued to play with well into their teenage years. Diana also shares Kelsey&rsquo;s deep love of Gilmore Girls, the Olsen Twins, spelling long words, and shopping for inappropriate amounts of time. Diana and Kelsey were actively involved in their Girl Scout troop for far longer than is appropriate for well-adjusted young women. Diana&rsquo;s only-child status afforded Kelsey sister privilege on many childhood trips to musicals, Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard, and every craft fair in Virginia (thanks, Jurgielewiczs!). Diana is the best web developer the world has ever known and is a red panda in human form.</p>

                    <p class="wed-party-name">Kristin King</p>
                    <p class="wed-party-backstory">Kelsey admired Kristin&rsquo;s drawing of a mouse grocery store in their third grade class (though Kristin claims they met years earlier) and is still in awe of Kristin&rsquo;s creative skills. Kristin significantly increased Kelsey&rsquo;s street cred in high school by taking her to shows at the 9:30 Club and by not telling people how much they loved John Mayer (cat&rsquo;s out of the bag now!). Despite the distance between DC and Philly, Kelsey and Kristin stay in touch through near-constant texting about the new reality shows they&rsquo;re planning and how many times one can wear the same Forever21 shirt without washing it.</p>

                    <p class="wed-party-backstory">Natalie came into Kelsey&rsquo;s life when HanFam needed a fourth roommate to fill out the house, and within days they were choreographing modern dance routines alone in the living room and sharing serving bowls of Stovetop stuffing. Natalie&rsquo;s lack of driver&rsquo;s license has allowed her to spend countless hours in the passenger seat of Kelsey&rsquo;s car, singing Sara Bareilles and plotting Wawa stops. Natalie and Kelsey have also run about 1,247 races together and will probably win one someday, holding hands across the finish line and feeding each other pizza after.</p>

                    <p class="wed-party-backstory">Chris and Jim met in the dorms at UW-Madison when Chris noticed Jim loudly playing annoying music from his dorm room (potentially Enya) and Jim noticed Chris swagger-walking through the co-ed dorm after raining three pointers in a pick-up game at the NAT and dirt-balling some unsuspecting freshman in Halo. The bromance refused to die. Chris is one of Jim&rsquo;s longest adulthood friends and Jim can&rsquo;t wait to let Chris re-use Jim&rsquo;s already-used couches for many more years.</p>

                    <p class="wed-party-backstory">After meeting in their graduate school program at Vanderbilt, Jim and Shaka have embarked on three separate road trips in three years which covered a total of 18,000 miles in Jim&rsquo;s leased Toyota Corolla. 24 states and 3 Canadian provinces later, they have eaten over 30 pounds of Twizzlers. Shaka is one of those thoughtful, fun, down-for-anything friends and has helped Jim through a debilitating case of backseat driving and life in general. Good luck not talking to this guy and loving him immediately.</p>

                    <p class="wed-party-backstory">Peter&rsquo;s unkempt hair, &quot;gluten intolerance&quot; and ability to give himself pink eye have elevated him to a level of almost unthinkable, grotesque legend. He has stayed one of Jim&rsquo;s closest, albeit long distance, pals over the years. Peter and Jim have that sort of friendship where, after multi-year gaps in visitation, they can pick up right where they left off. Also, they shared an apartment, a love of music, and the need to constantly fight for the attention of Shenkles the Cat.</p>

                    <p class="wed-party-backstory">Ben, aka Benny Z, is one of Jim&rsquo;s closest pals in DC. After somehow never meeting in college, though they share literally 75% of the same friends, they bonded over crushing Packers playoff defeats, ZZ Pizza, biking, and other unsavory things that can&rsquo;t be mentioned on a wedding website. Ben is one of those guys who will always ask the right questions to let a you get what you need off your chest and then sneakily get out Settlers of Catan to get refocus from your gripe onto more important things like road-building.</p>
